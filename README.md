# 🌐 Portfolio — Joëlle de Vlam

A personal **portfolio website** built and designed by **Joëlle de Vlam** to showcase creative work, academic projects, and personal development as part of the *ICT & Media Design* program at **Fontys University of Applied Sciences**.

## ✨ Overview

This website is an interactive, one-page portfolio with a clean and playful look.  
It focuses on **frontend development**, **interaction design**, and **smooth user experience**.

Key features:
- 📄 **Paper stack animation** — a layered stack of “sheets,” where one sheet expands to reveal the *About me* section.  
- 💬 **About me pop-up** — expands smoothly from the stack with a blurred background overlay.  
- 🧭 **Smart navigation** — the active link in the navbar updates dynamically based on scroll position.  
- 🖱️ **Smooth scrolling** — seamless transitions between Home and Projects sections.  
- 🌊 **Background rings** — subtle fixed radial gradients for depth and movement.  
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** — includes swipe up/down gestures to navigate or close the pop-up.
